## Learning Algorithm

My learning algorithm is a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.  

DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm and primarily uses two neural networks.  
One for the actor and one for the critic. These networks calculate action vectors for the current state and and generate 
a temporal-difference error signal each time step.

DDPG uses a stochastic behavioral policy for good exploration and a deterministic target policy for estimating.

The current state is the input of the actuator network and the output is a single value representing the action. The deterministic policy gradient theorem provides the update rule for the weights of the actor network.  

The critic's output is simply the estimated Q-value of the current state and the action given by the actor.
The critic network is updated from the gradients obtained  from the TD error signal.

My implementation is based on "[ddpg-pendulum implementation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-pendulum)" and extended by details like e.g. batch normalization and modfied hyperparamters.

In my implementation the Actor network contains two hidden layers of 128 devices with ReLU activation applied to both layers and a tanh on the end.  
In addition, a batch normalization is applied to the input and between the hidden layers.  

The Critical network also has two hidden layers with 128 units and ReLU Activation on both layers.
